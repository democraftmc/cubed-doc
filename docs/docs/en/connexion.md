# Connexion on Java Edition
### Suported Versions
We advice you yo play witha version bewteen 1.19 and 1.20, and to not use 1.20.2. 1.18 versions are supported, but you will miss some new blocks added in the news update and you will not reicive support in case of texture pack bug. 1.20.2 is not entirely supported by the proxy, so you can try, but it may not be possible if I not change the proxy in the nexts deays

### How to connect
On java edition, it's simple :
1. Click on multiplayer button
2. Click on add a server
3. In server name, put whatever you want, example here `DEMOCRAFT`
4. in the IP adress field, put the java ip adress of DEMOCRAFT, so `play.democraft.fr`
   
:fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation: Check that the `Texture Pack` option is set to enable. Else the server will be glitched!

# Crack Thing
### Is cracked players authorized ?
Simple Answer: No

Complex Answer: Our server was aim to be compatible to all versions and all accounts, but due to the recent EULA changes, we where obligated to change our system and not allowing crack

**If you really want to play:** We are not authorized to promote crack client, but if you found one, a bedrock cracked application would work with our server as Xbox authentification is the same
### And if you use TLauncher
Uninstall it rn. Please. It's a virus (no jokes)
