# Connexion on Java Edition
### Suported Versions
We advice you yo play witha version bewteen 1.19 and 1.20, and to not use 1.20.2. 1.18 versions are supported, but you will miss some new blocks added in the news update and you will not reicive support in case of texture pack bug. 1.20.2 is not entirely supported by the proxy, so you can try, but it may not be possible if I not change the proxy in the nexts deays

### How to connect
On java edition, it's simple :
1. Click on multiplayer button
2. Click on add a server
3. In server name, put whatever you want, example here `DEMOCRAFT`
4. in the IP adress field, put the java ip adress of DEMOCRAFT, so `play.democraft.fr`
   
  :fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation: Check that the `Texture Pack` option is set to enable. Else the server will be glitched!
### And That's it!
If you have problems while log-in, contact [our support on Discord](https://dsc.gg/democraft).
