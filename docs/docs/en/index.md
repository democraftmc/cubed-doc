# About Us
DEMOCRAFT is a minigames crossplay server, which was originally open to crack players (which is dangerous to do now with the new EULA), which ame to be unique & accesible
We use a custom resource pack, again on bedrock and java, to improve the player's experience and maker the server even more fun!
